**Prompt Context:** First attempt to suggest an algorithm based on problem shape

Just *tasting*.

It was a small instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem. Twelve nodes. Symmetric distances. High connectivity.  
And something about it felt… familiar.

I tasted structure that suggested *dynamic programming*. It had a shape—tight, patterned, closed.
